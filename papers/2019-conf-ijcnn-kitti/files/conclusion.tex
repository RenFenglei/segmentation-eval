\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This work addressed the problem of merging side outputs extracted from the convolutional layer model VGG to create region propositions for the task of image segmentation. It was evaluated the use of $add()$, $avg()$ and $max()$ merging strategies to combine the side results. The functions to enhance were evaluated using a cross-entropy and pixel-error loss functions. It was also studied the impact that the number of side outputs and a version without any side outputs in a similiar network. At last, a simple mathematical morphology operation was proposed to  enhance the performance on the task and remove some noises. 

Experiments demonstrated that the $avg()$ function is viable for merging maps with different sizes and connotations, and could place the proposed strategy among the state-of-the-art approaches for the task on the Kitti dataset. The use of $avg()$ merging strategy was adopted before in \cite{liu2017}, but no explanation was given to the use of this method over other possible merging strategies. This paper helps to explain the good results achieved by those researchers.

It was also demonstrated that a large amount of side outputs increases the network capabilities during the training step and could also create jumps that could lead to better performance, in terms of accuracy. The training graphs also show that number of side outputs contributes for a faster decay in loss function and stable results. The post-processing strategy slightly improved the performance, but requires further studies.

This research opens novel opportunities for study such as: (i) exploring different merging functions, less susceptible a values fluctuations;  (ii) explore regularization techniques to sustain larger amounts of side outputs consistent; and (iii) insert the mathematical morphology kernels on the learning process to search for the best kernel size.
