\subsection{The Kitti dataset}

KITTI Vision Benchmarking Suite is a project of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago to provide a real-world computer vision benchmark for autonomous driving platform Annieway. KITTI contains benchmarks and datasets for the following area of interests: stereo, optical flow, visual odometry, 3D object detection and 3D tracking.

One of the benchmarks in the KITTI suite is the Road/Lane Dataset Evaluation \cite{KITTI}. The road and lane estimation benchmark consists of 289 training and 290 test images, in four different categories of road scenes \cite{KITTI}:

\begin{itemize}
 \item uu - urban unmarked (98 training images and 100 test images) \cite{KITTI};
 \item um - urban marked (95 training images and 96 test images) \cite{KITTI};
 \item umm - urban multiple marked lanes (96 training images and 94 test images) \cite{KITTI};
 \item urban - combination of the three above \cite{KITTI}.
\end{itemize}

Ground truth has been generated by manual annotation of the images and is available for two different road terrain types: road - the road area (the composition of all lanes), and lane (the ego-lane, the lane the vehicle is currently driving on) \cite{KITTI} . Ground truth is provided for training images only \cite{KITTI}. 

As the dataset does not provide test ground truth, the results must be evaluated using a benchmarking tool provided with the dataset. This tool  performs road and lane estimation in the birds-eye-view space \cite{KITTI} . The metrics used are Maximum F1-measure, Average precision as used in PASCAL VOC challenges, Precision, Recall, False Positive Rate, False Negative Rate, F1 score and Hit Rate \cite{KITTI}.
