# Image segmentation for Lane Line Segmentation and Border Detection

## Source Code

To configure the virtual environment, import the Anaconda [i2dl.yml](code/i2dl.yml) .yml file, as instructed below. The evaluation environment only runs with Python 3.

```
conda env create -f i2dl.yml
```

The step-by-step approach to running the neural network already trained, training for the Kitti and BSDS500 databases, and performance evaluation is available in the source code tutorial.

## KITTI Performance Evaluation

To configure the virtual environment, import the Anaconda [kitti.yml](eval/kitti.yml) file, as described below. The evaluation environment only runs with Python 2.

```
conda env create -f kitty.yml
```
